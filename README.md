### Testing

TODO: Add testing instructions

#### Testing methodolgy

Due to the site being a static site generator, we are not doing really any functional testing. We are instead doing primarily snapshot testing.

That is testing if the current output matches what it did in the past, this is to ensure any changes we make doesn't break anything in the future.
