  For our first collaborative effort this year, we are delighted to be joined by Commercial Awareness Society, who have invited Paul Martin from nQ ZebraWorks to give a talk about how us, as Computing students, can find a role in the Law industry. There will also be a discussion around the topic of tech in the law industry, so you can really give yourself the edge in interviews and applications.
