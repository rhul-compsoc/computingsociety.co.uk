  Royal Hackaway is Royal Holloway's annual hackathon, open to university students from anywhere around the UK and the world!
  Spend the two days as a team working together on a project, attend any of our workshops or talks, and meet new people virtually!

  Royal Hackaway v4 will be our first online-only event, and streamed live to you.
